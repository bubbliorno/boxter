# Project: Creating a website and hosting it

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use HTML and CSS to make a website. In addition, I will be learning how to host my website and link a custom domain to it. Along the way, I will be learning about IP addresses, port forwarding, URL redirection, and HTTPS enforcement. This repository serves to document my learning process.
